\section{Distributed Linearizability}
\label{sec:distributed-lin}

Let us now concentrate on the definition of \crdtlin{} -- the main
contribution of this paper.
%

\gpnote*{}{I think histories should come after sequential specs}
\subsection{Histories}
\label{subsec:histories}

Firstly we will introduce the notion of \emph{histories} to represent
abstractly the execution of a concrete client operating on an
implementation of the data structure.

Histories are composed of operation labels.
An operation label $\alabellong{\argv}{\retv}$ represents the call of a method
$\amethod \in \methods$, with argument $a \in \datadomain$, and
resulting in the value $b \in \datadomain$.

We assume that in a history all labels are unique.
Since there might be multiple calls to the same method with the same
arguments and result, we will tag labels with a unique identifier $i$
as in $\alabellongind{\argv}{\retv}{i}$.
However, since we assume all labels are unique we will ignore
identifiers when unambiguous.
We can now define execution \emph{histories}.

\gpnote[nomargin, inline]{Maybe we have an overlap of IDs}
% We assume a set $\aopid \in \opids$ to represent unique \emph{operation identifiers}.


\begin{definition}[histories]
  \label{definition:histories} An execution history is a tuple of the form
  $(\alabelset, \avisord)$, where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\alabelset$ is the set of labels representing the operations of
    the execution,
  % \item $\arepord \in (\alabelset \times \alabelset)$ is the
  %   \emph{replica order}, a binary relation between the labels of the
  %   execution, such that when restricted to labels of operations generated
  %   by each single replica it is a total order, and it does not relate labels of
  %   operations from different replicas, and
  \item $\avisord \in (\alabelset \times \alabelset)$ is the
    \emph{visibility order}, an \emph{acyclic partial order}
    relation between the labels of the execution, such that if $(\alabel,
    \alabel') \in \avisord$ then the operation corresponding to the label
    $\alabel'$ witnessed in its execution the effects of the operation
    with label $\alabel$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Sequential Specification}
\label{subsec:sequential specification}

For specifications we will consider sets of sequences of labels, each
paired with an abstract visibility relation $\avisord$ relating the
labels in the sequence.


%\gp{We should add the specifications (even non-deterministic here.)}
\begin{definition}[Sequential Specification]
  \label{definition:sequential specification} A sequential
  specification is a set of tuples $(\alabelset, \aseqord)$, where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\alabelset$ is a set of labels, and
  \item $\aseqord$ is a sequence including all the labels in $\alabelset$,
    representing a sequential execution of the operations.
  % \item and $\avisord$ is a partial order over $\alabelset$,
  %   representing the visibility relation of the operations, and
  % \item we require that $\aseqord$ and $\avisord$ be consistent with
  %   each other, that is $(\aseqord \cup \avisord)^+$ is acyclic.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

To describe sequential specifications in a succinct way we will
provide an operational description.
To that end, we will associate to specifications a notion of abstract
state, which we shall generally denote by $\abstate$ and its domain
shall be denoted by $\abstates$.
Then to each valid label $\alabel$ we will associate a transition
function $\absopsemplain$ which given an initial state, and provided
that the label can be applied into that state, it will result into a
new abstract state.
Hence, we denote by $\absopsem{\abstate} = \abstate'$ the fact that
the resulting state for label $\alabel$ with initial state $\abstate$
is $\abstate'$.
%
To simplify our descriptions, we will use a shortcut notation for
$\absopsem{\abstate} = \abstate'$ and will write it as:
\[ \abstate \xrightarrow{\alabel}  \abstate' \]

In the specific case where the label $\alabel$ assumes a certain
precondition $\apre$ over the initial abstract state $\abstate$ we
will use Hoare-style triples and write
\[ \big(\abstate\ |\ \apre(\abstate)\big) \xrightarrow{\alabel}  \abstate' \]

A sequential specification then is the set of labels that are accepted
by the successive application of the transition function starting from
some given initial state $\abstate_{i}$.

\begin{example}[sequential specification of counter]
\label{definition:sequential specification of counter}
The sequential specification $\mathit{counter}_s$ of counter is so
that $\abstates = \mathbb{Z}$, that is the state will be an integer,
and the transitions are given as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $k \xrightarrow{\alabellong[\mathsf{inc}]{}{}} k+1$
\item[-] $k \xrightarrow{\alabellong[\mathsf{dec}]{}{}} k-1$
\item[-] $k \xrightarrow{\alabellong[\mathsf{read}]{}{k}} k$
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\gpwarning{Complete the others}

\begin{example}[sequential specification of multi-value register]
\label{def:spec-MVR}
The sequential specification $\mathit{MVReg}_s$ of multi-value
register is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each
its element $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$, an
identifier $\mathit{id} \in \mathbb{O}$, and a flag $f \in \{
\mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$ $(write(a),\mathit{id},S_1)$ $\{
  \mathit{state} = S[(b,\mathit{id}_1) \in S_2 : \mathit{false}] \cup
  \{ (a,id,\mathit{true}) \} \}$. Here $S_2 = \{ (b,\mathit{id}_1)
  \vert (b,\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{true}) \in S \wedge id \in S_1 \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{ a \vert
  (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $read() \Rightarrow S_1$ $\{
  \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[set and its sequential specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification of set}
A set has three methods: $\mathit{add}(a)$ inserts item $a$ into set;
$\mathit{rem}(a)$ removes $a$ from set; and $\mathit{read}$ returns
the set content.
% It implicitly assumes that each item being put into the set only
% once.
% Here we assume that when a item is removed, it will never be added
% again.
Here we assume that $\mathit{rem}$ will also be checked for
visibility.
The sequential specification $\mathit{set}_s$ of set is given as
follows:  Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its element $(a,f)$
is a tuple of a data $a$ and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_) \notin S \}$
  $(\mathit{add}(a),\mathit{id})$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \cup \{
  (a,\mathit{true}) \} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_) \in S \}$
  $(\mathit{add}(a),\mathit{id})$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_) \in S \}$
  $(\mathit{rem}(a))$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[a: \mathit{false} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{a \vert
  (a,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow S_1)$
  $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}


\begin{example}[OR-set and its sequential specification]
\label{def:specification-ORS}
OR-set is essential a multi-set: $\mathit{add}(a)$ inserts an item $a$
into multi-set; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ cancels only items $a$ that are
inserted by $\mathit{add}(a)$ operations visible to this remove
operation; $\mathit{read}$ returns the set of items in multi-set. A
value can be inserted multiple times.

The sequential specification $\mathit{OR}$-$\mathit{set}_s$ of OR-set
is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its
element $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$, an identifier
$\mathit{id}$, and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.
% In $((rem(a),\mathit{id}'),S_1)$, $S_1$ represents the operations
% visible to this remove operation.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S  \wedge (\_,\mathit{id},\_) \notin S
  \}$ $(\mathit{add}(a),\mathit{id})$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \cup \{
  (a,\mathit{id},\mathit{true}) \} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{ a \vert
  (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow
  S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_,\_) \in S\}$
  $(rem(a),S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[(a,\mathit{id}_1) \in S_2 :
  \mathit{false}] \}$. Here $S_2 = \{ (a,\mathit{id}_1) \vert
  (a,\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{true}) \in S \wedge id \in S_1 \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}


\begin{example}[register and its sequential specification]
\label{def:spec-register}
A register has two methods: $\mathit{write}(a)$ writes $a$ into
register; $\mathit{read}$ returns the value of register. The
sequential specification $\mathit{reg}_s$ of register is given as
follows: Let $\mathit{state} \in \mathbb{D}$ be a value.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = a  \}$ $\mathit{write}(b)$ $\{
  \mathit{state} = b \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = a \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow a)$
  $\{ \mathit{state} = a \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}


\begin{example}[List with add-after interface]
\label{definition:spec-list-add-after}
Assume each item of the list is unique. A list has three methods:
$\mathit{add}(b,a)$ inserts item $b$ into the list at the position
immediately after that of item $a$; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ removes item $a$
from the list; and $\mathit{read}$ returns the list content. We assume
that the initial value of list is $(\circ,\mathit{true})$ and this
node can not be removed. We use the word ``add-after'' to emphasize
the method $\mathit{add}(b,a)$, which is different from the other list
interface that uses method $\mathit{add}(b,a,c)$.

The sequential specification $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{af}}$ of list
is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a sequence, where each
item is a tuple $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ with data $a$, identifier
$\mathit{id}$ and flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.
Here $\mathit{af}$ represents add-after, and we use $l \uparrow_{S}$
to represent the projection of sequence $l$ into set $S$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots
  \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \wedge k \leq n \wedge b \notin \{
  a_1, \ldots, a_n \} \wedge \mathit{id}_k \in S_1 \}$
  $(add(b,a_k),\mathit{id},S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} =
  (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_k,\mathit{id}_k,f_k)
  \cdot (b,\mathit{id},\mathit{true}) \cdot
  (a_{k+1},\mathit{id}_{k+1},f_{k+1}) \cdot \ldots \cdot
  (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots
  \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \wedge k \leq n \wedge \mathit{id}_k
  \in S_1 \}$ $(rem(a_k),S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} =
  (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot
  (a_k,\mathit{id}_k,\mathit{false}) \cdot \ldots \cdot
  (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots
  \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \wedge S = \{ a \vert
  (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in \mathit{state} \} \wedge l = a_1 \cdot
  \ldots \cdot a_n \uparrow_{S} \}$ $(read() \Rightarrow l)$ $\{
  \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot
  (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \}$.
\end{itemize}
When the context is clear, in $\mathit{read}$ operation, we will omit
$\circ$.
\end{example}


\subsection{Definition of Distributed \CRDTLin{}}
\label{subsec:definition of distributed linearizability}

We now provide our definition of linearizability.
To simplify the argument we will assume for the time being that all
labels in a specification can be classified into update labels
$\alabel_{up} \in \Updates$ and into $\alabel_{qr} \in \Queries$.
Later we will extend the framework to consider query/update
operations.

We will generally assume that methods are predefined as either update
or query, and labels are defined according to the method.
In general however, given a specification in the operational style
described above, we can identify a label as an update if in its
specification the state before and after are different.
Formally, if $\abstate \xrightarrow{\alabel} \abstate'$ belongs to $\Spec$
and $\abstate \neq \abstate'$ we say that $\alabel$ is an update, and
$\alabel \in \Updates$.\footnote{We assume that labels are
  consistently update or query, should there be labels acting sometimes
  as update and sometimes as only query, a simple renaming would suffice
  to distinguish them.}
A label is said to be a query if it is not an update.
We will later add an additional case for query/update labels.

The intuition of our definition of \crdtlin{} is that for update
operations there is a global linear sequence (or history) which can
produce the final state obtained by the execution.
In other words, any state observed by any replica should be the result
of a prefix of this sequential history.
This notion is akin to Linearizability~\cite{HerlihyW90} when
constrained to update-only operations.

Evidently, this notion does not extend to query operations, since in
our semantical model replicas can see a subset of the global updates
performed at any moment, then we must allow for queries to read a
sub-sequence of the updates in the global sequence mentioned above.
In particular, queries should be justified by considering the
sub-sequence of the global sequence restricted to the updates that are
visible to it.
We will make these notions precise in~\autoref{definition:distributed
  linearizability} below.


\gpnote*{We consider single-object only in this section} {A history is
  single-object, if it contains operations of a single object.
  A history is multi-object, if it contains operations of multiple
  objects.}
In the following we propose distributed linearizability for histories.
\gpwarning*{}{We have to say that we distinguish query and update
  labels, perhaps define formally (for queries the visibility is
  important, updates change the state, but the visibility might not be
  important.)}

Before defining $\crdtlin{}$ it will be useful to present a definition
of linearizability as given by Herlihy and Wing~\cite{HerlihyW90} but
specialized for our notion of histories.
We shall call this notion \HWLin{}.

\begin{definition}[\HWLin{}]
  A history $h = (\alabelset,\avisord)$ is related by \HWLin{}
  w.r.t.
  a sequential specification \Spec{}, if there exists a specification
  history $(\alabelset, \aseqord) \in \Spec$,
  called the \hwlinearization{} of $h$, where we require that $\aseqord$ be
  consistent with $\avisord$ (i.e.
  $(\aseqord \cup \avisord)^+$ is acyclic).
  % Notice that this means that the visibility of operations in the
  % \hwlinear{} history is exactly the prefix in $\aseqord$ up to that
  % operation.
\end{definition}

This notion is too strong in general as we have shown in the examples
of~\autoref{sec:CRDT implementations}.
We shall relax this definition to accept histories where
not all operations are seen by every query.

\begin{definition}[\CRDTLin{}]
  \label{definition:distributed linearizability} A history $h =
  (\alabelset,\avisord)$ is \CRDTLin{} w.r.t. a
  \gpnote*{First mention?}{deterministic} sequential specification
  \Spec{}, if there exists a specification sequence
  $(\alabelset, \aseqord) \in \Spec{}$, called the
  \crdtlinearization{} of $h$, where we remark that the set of labels
  are identical, and such that %
  % \gpwarning*{}{This definition has to be worked out again}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item \aseqord{} is consistent with  \avisord{}, that is: $(\avisord
    \cup \aseqord)^{+}$ is acyclic,
  \item the projection of $\aseqord$ to \emph{update-only} labels is
    \hwlinearizable{} w.r.t. $\Spec$, i.e.
    $\aseqord\!\uparrow_{\Updates} \in \Spec$, where we denote by
    $\aseqord\uparrow_{S}$ the restriction of the order $\aseqord$ to
    the subset $S$, and
  \item for each query label $\alabel_{\mathsf{qr}}$,
    $\aseqord\!\uparrow_{\avisord^{-1}(\alabel_{\mathsf{qr}})}\!\cdot\
    \alabel_{\mathsf{qr}}$ be \hwlinearizable{} w.r.t. $\Spec$, i.e.
    $\aseqord\!\uparrow_{\avisord^{-1}(\alabel_{\mathsf{qr}})}\!\cdot\
    \alabel_{\mathsf{qr}} \in \Spec$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In a nutshell, this definition requires that for a given execution
history, there exists a sequential specification traces such
that
\begin{inparaenum}
\item the set of labels are the same and the sequential history is
  consistent with the visibility of the execution history, that
\item when restricted to update-only operations, the sequence belongs to
  the specification, and that
\item query operation can be justified by the specification based only
  on the updates that precede it in the sequence.
\end{inparaenum}


A set $H$ of histories is \crdtlinearizable{} w.r.t
a sequential specifications $\Spec$, if each of its history is
\crdtlinearizable{}.
%

An important property of CRDT algorithms is \emph{convergence}.
Convergence means that all replicas will arrive to the same final
state when the same set of operations are applied to them.
For the moment we concentrate on specifications that are
\emph{deterministic}.
That is to say that for every label, the transition from a given
initial state can produce at most one final state.
We will later remove this restriction.
It is useful to remark that if the specification of a CRDT is
deterministic, then our definition of \crdtlin{} implies the
convergence of the data type, as formalized in the following lemma.

% A multi-object history $h$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t
% deterministic sequential specifications, if for each object $x$, $h
% \uparrow_{x}$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t its sequential
% specification.

% Here the linearization gives a global and linearizable explanation of
% all operations. With sequential specification and linearization of
% the history, the understanding of distributed behaviors should be
% simplified. The linearization can be also considered as a guide to
% the conflict resolution.

% \autoref{fig:a distributed linearizable history} is a history
% of OR-set. Here subscript of $\mathit{add}_1(a)$ is used to
% distinguish different $\mathit{add}(a)$ operations, and similarly for
% $\mathit{read}_1() \Rightarrow \{ a,b \}$. This history is
% distributed linearizable. To explain this, let the operation
% identifiers of operations of the first replica (resp., of the second
% replica) be $\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{id}_2,\mathit{id}_3,\mathit{id}_4$
% (resp., $\mathit{id}_5,\mathit{id}_6,\mathit{id}_7,\mathit{id}_8$),
% in the replica order, respectively. The linearization of this history
% is $\mathit{add}_1(a) \cdot \mathit{add}_1(b) \cdot \mathit{add}_2(b)
% \cdot \mathit{add}_2(a) \cdot ((\mathit{rem}(b),\_,\_),\{
% \mathit{id}_1, \mathit{id}_2 \}) \cdot ((\mathit{rem}(a),\_,\_),\{
% \mathit{id}_5, \mathit{id}_6 \}) \cdot ((\mathit{read}_1 \Rightarrow
% \{ a,b \},\_,\_), S ) \cdot ((\mathit{read}_2 \Rightarrow \{ a,b
% \},\_,\_), S )$, where $S = \{ \mathit{id}_1, \mathit{id}_2,
% \mathit{id}_3, \mathit{id}_5, \mathit{id}_6, \mathit{id}_7 \}$.

% The history of \autoref{fig:a distributed linearizable
% history} is distributed linearizable w.r.t
% $\mathit{OR}$-$\mathit{set}_s$, but not $\mathit{set}_s$. Assume that
% by contradiction, this history is linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{set}_s$
% and $\mathit{lin}$ is its linearization. Then it is obvious that to
% ensure $b$ be in the return value of $\mathit{read}_1$, we should put
% $\mathit{add}_1(b)$ after $\mathit{rem}(b)$ in $\mathit{lin}$; then
% $\mathit{add}_2(a)$ is after $\mathit{add}_1(b)$ in in
% $\mathit{lin}$, and $\mathit{rem}(a)$ is after $\mathit{add}_2(a)$ in
% in $\mathit{lin}$. However, this makes $a$ not in return value of
% $\mathit{read}_2$ according to $\mathit{set}_s$, which introduces
% contradiction. Therefore, it seems quite difficult to have a
% sequential specification of OR-set without using special methods.

% \end{figure}

% \autoref{fig:a non-distributed linearizable history} is a
% history of list with add-after interface. It is not distributed
% linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{af}}$, since the
% operation $\mathit{read} \Rightarrow a \cdot b \cdot c$ can not be
% validated. By enumerating all possible linearizations, the only
% possible valid return value of this $\mathit{read}$ operation are $a
% \cdot c \cdot b$ and $b \cdot a \cdot c$.

% \gpnote*{}{I have to add the stuff about query/update operations}


% \gpnote*{Not sure where this is going}
% {We say a history satisfy convergence, if given query operations
% $o_1$ and $o_2$ of this history, if $o_1$ and $o_2$ see the same set
% of update operations, then they observe from ``a same abstract
% state''. Or we can say, when such $o_1$ and $o_2$ are of same
% method, they should return same value. A sequential specification is
% deterministic, if from one state and one transition label, there is
% at most one destination state. It is obvious that all sequential
% specification examples are deterministic. By definition
% \ref{definition:distributed linearizability}, our distributed
% linearizability for deterministic sequential specification obviously
% implies convergence, as stated by the following lemma.}

% Intuitively, we intends to use linearization to do conflict
% resolution. This works well for deterministic sequential
% specification. However, when the sequential specification becomes
% nondeterministic, linearization is not enough to do conflict
% resolution. This is the reason for this anomaly. Note that a
% nondeterministic sequential specification, such as
% $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, does not mean that in algorithm
% they choose random position for an item or they do conflict
% resolution in a random style. For example, in latter section we will
% see that a list algorithm called WOOT is distributed linearizable
% w.r.t $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, while WOOT ensures
% convergence. The reason for using $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$
% for WOOT is that: in $\mathit{add}(b,a,c)$ method of WOOT, the
% position of item $b$ is determined by some associated detailed
% information of item $b$ which is too detail for specification; and
% the position of $b$ is neither the immediate position after that of
% $a$, or the position immediate before that of $c$.

% To deal with nondeterministic sequential specification, we added an
% additionally condition in distributed linearization definition: Let
% $s_0$ be the initial state of sequential specification,

% \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
% \item For each query operation $o$, if $s_0 {\xrightarrow{
% \mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathit{vis}^{-1}(o)  } \cdot o }} s$, and
% $s_0 {\xrightarrow{ \mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathbb{U} } } } s'$,
% then $s$ is a ``sub-state'' of $s'$.
% \end{enumerate}

% For $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$ we interpret this condition as:
% If $s = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_k,b_k)$ and $s' =
% (a'_1,f'_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a'_n,f'_n)$, then $a_1 \cdot \ldots
% \cdot a_k$ is a sub-sequence of $a'_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a'_n$. The
% following lemma states that our distributed linearizability implies
% convergence. It holds for $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, since our
% additional condition ensure that if two $\mathit{read}$ operation
% sees same set of $\mathit{add}$ and $\mathit{rem}$ operations, then
% their local state must be the same.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:distributed linarizability implies convergence}
If a history $h$ is \crdtlinearizable{} w.r.t. a deterministic
sequential specification \Spec, then $h$ is convergent.
