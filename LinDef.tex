\section{Distributed Linearizability}
\label{sec:distributed-lin}

Let us now concentrate on the definition of \crdtlin{} -- the main
contribution of this paper.
%

\gpnote*{}{I think histories should come after sequential specs}
\subsection{Histories}
\label{subsec:histories}

Firstly we will introduce the notion of \emph{histories} to represent
abstractly the execution of a concrete client operating on an
implementation of the data structure.

Histories are composed of operation labels.
An operation label $\alabellong{\argv}{\retv}$ represents the call of a method
$\amethod \in \methods$, with argument $a \in \datadomain$, and
resulting in the value $b \in \datadomain$.

We assume that in a history all labels are unique.
Since there might be multiple calls to the same method with the same
arguments and result, we will tag labels with a unique identifier $i$
as in $\alabellongind{\argv}{\retv}{i}$.
However, since we assume all labels are unique we will ignore
identifiers when unambiguous.
We can now define execution \emph{histories}.

\gpnote[nomargin, inline]{Maybe we have an overlap of IDs}
% We assume a set $\aopid \in \opids$ to represent unique \emph{operation identifiers}.


% $\mathbb{OID}$ is a infinite set of operation identifiers. An operation is defined to be a tuple $(\ell,i,x)$, where $\ell$ is a operation label, $i \in \mathbb{OID}$ is a unique operation identifier, and $x \in \mathbb{OBJ}$ is the objects of this operation. Let $\mathbb{OP}$ be the set of operations. For operation label $m(a) \Rightarrow b$, when the argument (resp., return value) is not used, we write $m()\Rightarrow b$ (resp., $m(a)$) instead for short.

% With the notion of operations, we can now define histories.

\begin{definition}[histories]
  \label{definition:histories} An execution history is a tuple of the form
  $(\alabelset, \avisord)$, where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\alabelset$ is the set of labels representing the operations of
    the execution,
  % \item $\arepord \in (\alabelset \times \alabelset)$ is the
  %   \emph{replica order}, a binary relation between the labels of the
  %   execution, such that when restricted to labels of operations generated
  %   by each single replica it is a total order, and it does not relate labels of
  %   operations from different replicas, and
  \item $\avisord \in (\alabelset \times \alabelset)$ is the
    \emph{visibility order}, an \emph{acyclic partial order}
    relation between the labels of the execution, such that if $(\alabel,
    \alabel') \in \avisord$ then the operation corresponding to the label
    $\alabel'$ witnessed in its execution the effects of the operation
    with label $\alabel$.
  \end{enumerate}
  % Here $\mathit{Op} \subseteq \mathbb{OP}$ is a set of operations; $\mathit{ro} \subseteq \mathit{Op} \times \mathit{Op}$ is the replica order, which is a union of transitive, irreflexive and total orders over $\mathit{Op}$; $\mathit{vis} \subseteq \mathit{Op} \times \mathit{Op}$ is the visibility order, which is acyclic and relates operations of same object. We require that $\mathit{ro} \subseteq \mathit{vis}$, and $\mathit{vis}^*$ be acyclic.
\end{definition}

% $(o_1,o_2) \in \mathit{ro}$ represents that $o_1$ and $o_2$ are of same replica and the time point of $o_1$ is before that of $o_2$. $(o_1,o_2) \in \mathit{vis}$ means that $o_2$ is aware of $o_1$. %In detailed execution, this means that some message carrying the effect of $o_1$ has already been delivered into replica of $o_2$. In state-based CRDT implementation, this message contains some state aware of $o_1$, while in operation-based CRDT implementation, this message is the message of $o_1$. Based on this intuition, when
% We quire that for $(o_1,o_2) \in \mathit{vis}$, $o_1$ is of a update method, since only update methods have side-effect.

\subsection{Sequential Specification}
\label{subsec:sequential specification}

%A sequential specification intends to propose a linearizable explanation for distributed objects.

For specifications we will consider sets of sequences of labels, each
paired with an abstract visibility relation $\avisord$ relating the
labels in the sequence.

% A specification alphabet is a tuple $(\ell,\mathit{id},S)$, where $\ell$ is a operation label, $\mathit{id}$ is an identifier of this specification alphabet, and $S$ is a set of identifiers. Let $\mathbb{A}$ be the set of specification alphabets. A sequential specification of CRDT is defined as a set of sequences over specification alphabets $\mathbb{A}$.

%\gp{We should add the specifications (even non-deterministic here.)}
\begin{definition}[Sequential Specification]
  \label{definition:sequential specification} A sequential
  specification is a set of tuples $(\alabelset, \aseqord)$, where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\alabelset$ is a set of labels, and
  \item $\aseqord$ is a sequence including all the labels in $\alabelset$,
    representing a sequential execution of the operations.
  % \item and $\avisord$ is a partial order over $\alabelset$,
  %   representing the visibility relation of the operations, and
  % \item we require that $\aseqord$ and $\avisord$ be consistent with
  %   each other, that is $(\aseqord \cup \avisord)^+$ is acyclic.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

To describe sequential specifications in a succinct way we will
provide an operational description.
To that end, we will associate to specifications a notion of abstract
state, which we shall generally denote by $\abstate$ and its domain
shall be denoted by $\abstates$.
Then to each valid label $\alabel$ we will associate a transition
function $\absopsemplain$ which given an initial state, and provided
that the label can be applied into that state, it will result into a
new abstract state.
Hence, we denote by $\absopsem{\abstate} = \abstate'$ the fact that
the resulting state for label $\alabel$ with initial state $\abstate$
is $\abstate'$.
%
To simplify our descriptions, we will use a shortcut notation for
$\absopsem{\abstate} = \abstate'$ and will write it as:
\[ \abstate \xrightarrow{\alabel}  \abstate' \]

In the specific case where the label $\alabel$ assumes a certain
precondition $\apre$ over the initial abstract state $\abstate$ we
will use Hoare-style triples and write
\[ \big(\abstate\ |\ \apre(\abstate)\big) \xrightarrow{\alabel}  \abstate' \]

A sequential specification then is the set of labels that are accepted
by the successive application of the transition function starting from
some given initial state $\abstate_{i}$.

% The sequential specification is defined by transition rules of the form $\mathit{cond}_1$ $(m(a) \Rightarrow b,\mathit{id},S)$ $\mathit{cond}_2$, where $\mathit{cond}_1$ is a pre-condition and $\mathit{cond}_2$ is a post condition. When $\mathit{id}$ is not used in $\mathit{cond}_1$ and $\mathit{cond}_2$, we can skip it. When $S$ is not used in $\mathit{cond}_1$ and $\mathit{cond}_2$, we can skip it. We write $s {\xrightarrow{(m(a) \Rightarrow b,\mathit{id},S)}} s'$, if there exists a transition rule $\mathit{cond}_1$ $(m(a) \Rightarrow b,\mathit{id},S)$ $\mathit{cond}_2$, such that $s$ satisfies $\mathit{cond}_1$ and $s'$ satisfies $\mathit{cond}_2$. A sequence $(\ell_1,\mathit{id}_1,S_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (\ell_k,\mathit{id}_k,S_k)$ is in sequential specification, if there exists state $s_k$, such that $s_0 {\xrightarrow{(\ell_1,\mathit{id}_1,S_1)}} \ldots {\xrightarrow{(\ell_k,\mathit{id}_k,S_k)}} s_k$, and $s_0$ is the initial state. Here we also require that each $\mathit{id}$ is unique in $(\ell_1,\mathit{id}_1,S_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (\ell_k,\mathit{id}_k,S_k)$.



% For objects of simple types, a sequential specification is a set of operation sequences. Normally, the sequential specification is defined by the pre-condition and post-conditions. For example, the following is the sequential specification for distributed counter, and is given as a set of transition rules between states. Each state contains a integer value. Transition rule $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$ $(\mathit{inc},\_,\_)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = i+1 \}$ indicates that $\mathit{inc}$ will increase the state by $1$. Here we use $\_$ to indicate an element whose value has no influence. Since this rule does not use operation identifier and object, it is safe to write $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$ $\mathit{inc}$ $\{ \mathit{state} = i+1 \}$ instead. Similarly for $\mathit{dec}$ and $\mathit{read}$ operations. We write $s {\xrightarrow{o}} s'$ to indicate one step of $o$ transition between states $s$ and $s'$ that satisfies some transition %%ru.

% A sequence $(\ell_1,i_1,x) \cdot \ldots \cdot (\ell_k,i_k,x)$ is in sequential specification $\mathit{counter}_s$, if there exists state $s_k$, such that $s_0 {\xrightarrow{(\ell_1,i_1,x)}} \ldots {\xrightarrow{(\ell_k,i_k,x)}} s_k$, and $s_0$ is the initial state. For example, it is easy to see that $(\mathit{inc},\mathit{id}_1,x) \cdot (\mathit{inc},\mathit{id}_2,x) \cdot (\mathit{dec},\mathit{id}_3,x) \cdot (\mathit{read} \Rightarrow 1,\mathit{id}_4,x) \in \mathit{counter}_s$. Note that operations of one sequence of $\mathit{counter}_s$ must be of a same object. We also implicitly assume that each operation has a unique operation identifier.


\begin{example}[sequential specification of counter]
\label{definition:sequential specification of counter}
The sequential specification $\mathit{counter}_s$ of counter is so that $\abstates = \mathbb{Z}$, that is the state will be an integer, and the transitions are given as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $k \xrightarrow{\alabellong[\mathsf{inc}]{}{}} k+1$
\item[-] $k \xrightarrow{\alabellong[\mathsf{dec}]{}{}} k-1$
\item[-] $k \xrightarrow{\alabellong[\mathsf{read}]{}{k}} k$
\end{itemize}
% given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a integer with initial value $0$.
% \begin{itemize}
% \setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
% \item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = k \}$ $\mathit{inc}$ $\{ \mathit{state} = k+1 \}$.
% \item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = k \}$ $\mathit{dec}$ $\{ \mathit{state} = k-1 \}$.
% \item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = k \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow i)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = k \}$.
% \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\gpwarning{Complete the others}

%However, for objects of some types which are designed only for distributed system, such as multi-value register and OR-set, sequential specification in above style seems insufficient (we explain this in the next subsection). To solve this problem, in the transition rules of sequential specification, for some operations, we give them a additional argument which is a set of operation identifiers. Such additional argument essentially represents the operations visible to this operation. We use the sequential specification of multi-value register as example to explain this, which is shown below.

%Each state contains a set of tuples $(a,\mathit{id},f)$, where $a$ is item, $\mathit{id}$ is the operation identifier of the operation that put this tuple, and $f$ indicates whether this item is logically removed or not. Given a state $S$, a $(write(a),\mathit{id},x)$ operation with argument $S_1$, the resulting state is obtained by marking all items in $S$ with $S_1$ identifiers into $\mathit{false}$, and then insert $(a,id,\mathit{true})$ into $S$. A $\mathit{read}$ operation returns value with flag $\mathit{true}$ in state.


\begin{example}[sequential specification of multi-value register]
\label{definition:sequential specification of multi-value register}
The sequential specification $\mathit{MVReg}_s$ of multi-value register is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its element $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$, an identifier $\mathit{id} \in \mathbb{O}$, and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$ $(write(a),\mathit{id},S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[(b,\mathit{id}_1) \in S_2 : \mathit{false}]
\cup
\{ (a,id,\mathit{true}) \}
\}$. Here $S_2 = \{ (b,\mathit{id}_1) \vert (b,\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{true}) \in S \wedge id \in S_1 \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{ a \vert (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $read() \Rightarrow S_1$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}


%The methods that needs additional arguments, such as $\mathit{write}$ method of multi-value register and $\mathit{rem}$ method of OR-set, is called special methods of that specification. Given a sequential specification  A sequential specification is $\mathit{deterministic}$, if in each of its rules, from each state with each operation, there is at most one resulting state. Otherwise, it is a $\mathit{nondeterministic}$ specification. In the following we will introduce several types and their sequential specifications. $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, a version of list specification, is nondeterministic, while all other sequential specifications are deterministic.


\begin{example}[set and its sequential specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification of set}
A set has three methods: $\mathit{add}(a)$ inserts item $a$ into set; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ removes $a$ from set; and $\mathit{read}$ returns the set content. %It implicitly assumes that each item being put into the set only once.
%Here we assume that when a item is removed, it will never be added again.
Here we assume that $\mathit{rem}$ will also be checked for visibility.
The sequential specification $\mathit{set}_s$ of set is given as follows:  Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its element $(a,f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$ and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_) \notin S \}$ $(\mathit{add}(a),\mathit{id})$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \cup \{ (a,\mathit{true}) \} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_) \in S \}$ $(\mathit{add}(a),\mathit{id})$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_) \in S \}$ $(\mathit{rem}(a))$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[a: \mathit{false} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{a \vert (a,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}



\begin{example}[OR-set and its sequential specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification of or-set}
OR-set is essential a multi-set: $\mathit{add}(a)$ inserts an item $a$ into multi-set; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ cancels only items $a$ that are inserted by $\mathit{add}(a)$ operations visible to this remove operation; $\mathit{read}$ returns the set of items in multi-set. A value can be inserted multiple times.

The sequential specification $\mathit{OR}$-$\mathit{set}_s$ of OR-set is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its element $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$, an identifier $\mathit{id}$, and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$. %In $((rem(a),\mathit{id}'),S_1)$, $S_1$ represents the operations visible to this remove operation.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S  \wedge (\_,\mathit{id},\_) \notin S \}$ $(\mathit{add}(a),\mathit{id})$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \cup \{ (a,\mathit{id},\mathit{true}) \} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{ a \vert (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_,\_) \in S\}$ $(rem(a),S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[(a,\mathit{id}_1) \in S_2 : \mathit{false}] \}$. Here $S_2 = \{ (a,\mathit{id}_1) \vert (a,\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{true}) \in S \wedge id \in S_1 \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}


\begin{example}[register and its sequential specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification of register}
A register has two methods: $\mathit{write}(a)$ writes $a$ into register; $\mathit{read}$ returns the value of register. The sequential specification $\mathit{reg}_s$ of register is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state} \in \mathbb{D}$ be a value.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = a  \}$ $\mathit{write}(b)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = b \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = a \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow a)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = a \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}




\begin{example}[List with add-after interface]
\label{definition:sequential specification of list with add-after interface}
Assume each item of the list is unique. A list has three methods: $\mathit{add}(b,a)$ inserts item $b$ into the list at the position immediately after that of item $a$; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ removes item $a$ from the list; and $\mathit{read}$ returns the list content. We assume that the initial value of list is $(\circ,\mathit{true})$ and this node can not be removed. We use the word ``add-after'' to emphasize the method $\mathit{add}(b,a)$, which is different from the other list interface that uses method $\mathit{add}(b,a,c)$.

The sequential specification $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{af}}$ of list is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a sequence, where each item is a tuple $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ with data $a$, identifier $\mathit{id}$ and flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$. Here $\mathit{af}$ represents add-after, and we use $l \uparrow_{S}$ to represent the projection of sequence $l$ into set $S$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \wedge k \leq n \wedge b \notin \{ a_1, \ldots, a_n \} \wedge \mathit{id}_k \in S_1 \}$ $(add(b,a_k),\mathit{id},S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_k,\mathit{id}_k,f_k) \cdot (b,\mathit{id},\mathit{true}) \cdot (a_{k+1},\mathit{id}_{k+1},f_{k+1}) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \wedge k \leq n \wedge \mathit{id}_k \in S_1 \}$ $(rem(a_k),S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_k,\mathit{id}_k,\mathit{false}) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \wedge S = \{ a \vert (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in \mathit{state} \} \wedge l = a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n \uparrow_{S} \}$ $(read() \Rightarrow l)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,\mathit{id}_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,\mathit{id}_n,f_n) \}$.
\end{itemize}
When the context is clear, in $\mathit{read}$ operation, we will omit $\circ$.
\end{example}


\subsection{Definition of Distributed \CRDTLin{}}
\label{subsec:definition of distributed linearizability}

We now provide our definition of linearizability.
To simplify the argument we will assume for the time being that all
labels in a specification can be classified into update labels
$\alabel_{up} \in \Updates$ and into $\alabel_{qr} \in \Queries$.
Later we will extend the framework to consider query/update
operations.

We will generally assume that methods are predefined as either update
or query, and labels are defined according to the method.
In general however, given a specification in the operational style
described above, we can identify a label as an update if in its
specification the state before and after are different.
Formally, if $\abstate \xrightarrow{\alabel} \abstate'$ belongs to $\Spec$
and $\abstate \neq \abstate'$ we say that $\alabel$ is an update, and
$\alabel \in \Updates$.\footnote{We assume that labels are
  consistently update or query, should there be labels acting sometimes
  as update and sometimes as only query, a simple renaming would suffice
  to distinguish them.}
A label is said to be a query if it is not an update.
We will later add an additional case for query/update labels.

The intuition of our definition of \crdtlin{} is that for update
operations there is a global linear sequence (or history) which can
produce the final state obtained by the execution.
In other words, any state observed by any replica should be the result
of a prefix of this sequential history.
This notion is akin to Linearizability~\cite{HerlihyW90} when
constrained to update-only operations.

Evidently, this notion does not extend to query operations, since in
our semantical model replicas can see a subset of the global updates
performed at any moment, then we must allow for queries to read a
sub-sequence of the updates in the global sequence mentioned above.
In particular, queries should be justified by considering the
sub-sequence of the global sequence restricted to the updates that are
visible to it.
We will make these notions precise in~\autoref{definition:distributed
  linearizability} below.


\gpnote*{We consider single-object only in this section} {A history is
  single-object, if it contains operations of a single object.
  A history is multi-object, if it contains operations of multiple
  objects.}
In the following we propose distributed linearizability for histories.
\gpwarning*{}{We have to say that we distinguish query and update
  labels, perhaps define formally (for queries the visibility is
  important, updates change the state, but the visibility might not be
  important.)}

Before defining $\crdtlin{}$ it will be useful to present a definition
of linearizability as given by Herlihy and Wing~\cite{HerlihyW90} but
specialized for our notion of histories.
We shall call this notion \HWLin{}.

\begin{definition}[\HWLin{}]
  A history $h = (\alabelset,\avisord)$ is related by \HWLin{}
  w.r.t.
  a sequential specification \Spec{}, if there exists a specification
  history $(\alabelset, \aseqord) \in \Spec$,
  called the \hwlinearization{} of $h$, where we require that $\aseqord$ be
  consistent with $\avisord$ (i.e.
  $(\aseqord \cup \avisord)^+$ is acyclic).
  % Notice that this means that the visibility of operations in the
  % \hwlinear{} history is exactly the prefix in $\aseqord$ up to that
  % operation.
\end{definition}

This notion is too strong in general as we have shown in the examples
of~\autoref{sec:CRDT implementations}.
We shall relax this definition to accept histories where
not all operations are seen by every query.

\begin{definition}[\CRDTLin{}]
  \label{definition:distributed linearizability} A history $h =
  (\alabelset,\avisord)$ is \CRDTLin{} w.r.t. a 
  \gpnote*{First mention?}{deterministic} sequential specification
  \Spec{}, if there exists a specification sequence
  $(\alabelset, \aseqord) \in \Spec{}$, called the
  \crdtlinearization{} of $h$, where we remark that the set of labels
  are identical, and such that %
  % \gpwarning*{}{This definition has to be worked out again}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item \aseqord{} is consistent with  \avisord{}, that is: $(\avisord
    \cup \aseqord)^{+}$ is acyclic, 
  \item the projection of $\aseqord$ to \emph{update-only} labels is
    \hwlinearizable{} w.r.t. $\Spec$, i.e.
    $\aseqord\!\uparrow_{\Updates} \in \Spec$, where we denote by
    $\aseqord\uparrow_{S}$ the restriction of the order $\aseqord$ to
    the subset $S$, and 
  \item for each query label $\alabel_{\mathsf{qr}}$,
    $\aseqord\!\uparrow_{\avisord^{-1}(\alabel_{\mathsf{qr}})}\!\cdot\
    \alabel_{\mathsf{qr}}$ be \hwlinearizable{} w.r.t. $\Spec$, i.e.
    $\aseqord\!\uparrow_{\avisord^{-1}(\alabel_{\mathsf{qr}})}\!\cdot\ 
    \alabel_{\mathsf{qr}} \in \Spec$. 
\end{enumerate}

In a nutshell, this definition requires that for a given execution
history, there exists a sequential specification traces such
that
\begin{inparaenum}
\item the set of labels are the same and the sequential history is
  consistent with the visibility of the execution history, that
\item when restricted to update-only operations, the sequence belongs to
  the specification, and that
\item query operation can be justified by the specification based only
  on the updates that precede it in the sequence.
\end{inparaenum}

%A multi-object history $h$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t deterministic sequential specifications, if for each object $x$, $h \uparrow_{x}$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t its sequential specification.
A set $H$ of histories are distributed linearizable w.r.t deterministic sequential specifications, if each of its history is.
\end{definition}

%Here the linearization gives a global and linearizable explanation of all operations. With sequential specification and linearization of the history, the understanding of distributed behaviors should be simplified. The linearization can be also considered as a guide to the conflict resolution.

%\figurename~\ref{fig:a distributed linearizable history} is a history of OR-set. Here subscript of $\mathit{add}_1(a)$ is used to distinguish different $\mathit{add}(a)$ operations, and similarly for $\mathit{read}_1() \Rightarrow \{ a,b \}$. This history is distributed linearizable. To explain this, let the operation identifiers of operations of the first replica (resp., of the second replica) be $\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{id}_2,\mathit{id}_3,\mathit{id}_4$ (resp., $\mathit{id}_5,\mathit{id}_6,\mathit{id}_7,\mathit{id}_8$), in the replica order, respectively. The linearization of this history is $\mathit{add}_1(a) \cdot \mathit{add}_1(b) \cdot \mathit{add}_2(b) \cdot \mathit{add}_2(a) \cdot ((\mathit{rem}(b),\_,\_),\{ \mathit{id}_1, \mathit{id}_2 \}) \cdot ((\mathit{rem}(a),\_,\_),\{ \mathit{id}_5, \mathit{id}_6 \}) \cdot ((\mathit{read}_1 \Rightarrow \{ a,b \},\_,\_), S ) \cdot ((\mathit{read}_2 \Rightarrow \{ a,b \},\_,\_), S )$, where $S = \{ \mathit{id}_1, \mathit{id}_2, \mathit{id}_3, \mathit{id}_5, \mathit{id}_6, \mathit{id}_7 \}$.

%The history of \figurename~\ref{fig:a distributed linearizable history} is distributed linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{OR}$-$\mathit{set}_s$, but not $\mathit{set}_s$. Assume that by contradiction, this history is linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{set}_s$ and $\mathit{lin}$ is its linearization. Then it is obvious that to ensure $b$ be in the return value of $\mathit{read}_1$, we should put $\mathit{add}_1(b)$ after $\mathit{rem}(b)$ in $\mathit{lin}$; then $\mathit{add}_2(a)$ is after $\mathit{add}_1(b)$ in in $\mathit{lin}$, and $\mathit{rem}(a)$ is after $\mathit{add}_2(a)$ in in $\mathit{lin}$. However, this makes $a$ not in return value of $\mathit{read}_2$ according to $\mathit{set}_s$, which introduces contradiction. Therefore, it seems quite difficult to have a sequential specification of OR-set without using special methods.

%Intuitively, we intends to use linearization to do conflict resolution. This works well for deterministic sequential specification. However, when the sequential specification becomes nondeterministic, linearization is not enough to do conflict resolution. This is the reason for this anomaly. Note that a nondeterministic sequential specification, such as $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, does not mean that in algorithm they choose random position for an item or they do conflict resolution in a random style. For example, in latter section we will see that a list algorithm called WOOT is distributed linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, while WOOT ensures convergence. The reason for using $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$ for WOOT is that: in $\mathit{add}(b,a,c)$ method of WOOT, the position of item $b$ is determined by some associated detailed information of item $b$ which is too detail for specification; and the position of $b$ is neither the immediate position after that of $a$, or the position immediate before that of $c$.

%To deal with nondeterministic sequential specification, we added an additionally condition in distributed linearization definition: Let $s_0$ be the initial state of sequential specification,

%\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
%\item For each query operation $o$, if $s_0 {\xrightarrow{ \mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathit{vis}^{-1}(o)  } \cdot o }} s$, and $s_0 {\xrightarrow{ \mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathbb{U} } } } s'$, then $s$ is a ``sub-state'' of $s'$.
%\end{enumerate}

%For $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$ we interpret this condition as: If $s = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_k,b_k)$ and $s' = (a'_1,f'_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a'_n,f'_n)$, then $a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_k$ is a sub-sequence of $a'_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a'_n$. The following lemma states that our distributed linearizability implies convergence. It holds for $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, since our additional condition ensure that if two $\mathit{read}$ operation sees same set of $\mathit{add}$ and $\mathit{rem}$ operations, then their local state must be the same.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:distributed linarizability implies convergence}
If a history $h$ is distributed linearizability w.r.t deterministic sequential specification, then $h$ satisfies convergence.
\end{lemma}

\section{Distributed Linearizability}
\label{sec:distributed-lin}

In this section, we propose a framework to specify the expected outcome in a linearizable approach, without referring to implementation details.



\subsection{Histories}
\label{subsec:histories}

We define our specification on histories, which are abstract version of detailed executions and does not contain implementation details such as message delivery. Histories are used to capture the notion of client-observable effects (operations), as well as their order in each replica, and their visibility relation.

Let us introduce the notion of operations. A operation label $m(a) \Rightarrow b$ with $m \in \mathbb{M}$ and $a,b \in \mathbb{D}$ is the user-observable behavior of an operation, which indicates that this operation calls method $m$ with argument $a$ and its return value is $b$. An operation is defined to be a tuple $(\ell,i,x)$, where $\ell$ is a operation label, $i \in \mathbb{OID}$ is a unique operation identifier, and $x \in \mathbb{OBJ}$ is the objects of this operation. Let $\mathbb{OP}$ be the set of operations. For operation label $m(a) \Rightarrow b$, when the argument (resp., return value) is not used, we write $m()\Rightarrow b$ (resp., $m(a)$) instead for short.

With the notion of operations, we can now define histories.

\begin{definition}[histories]
\label{definition:histories}
A history is a tuple of the form $(\mathit{Op},\mathit{ro},\mathit{vis})$ .Here $\mathit{Op} \subseteq \mathbb{OP}$ is a set of operations; $\mathit{ro} \subseteq \mathit{Op} \times \mathit{Op}$ is the replica order, which is a union of transitive, irreflexive and total orders over $\mathit{Op}$; $\mathit{vis} \subseteq \mathit{Op} \times \mathit{Op}$ is the visibility order, which is acyclic and relates operations of same object. We require that $\mathit{ro} \subseteq \mathit{vis}$.
\end{definition}

$(o_1,o_2) \in \mathit{ro}$ represents that $o_1$ and $o_2$ are of same replica and the time point of $o_1$ is before that of $o_2$. $(o_1,o_2) \in \mathit{vis}$ means that $o_2$ is aware of $o_1$. In detailed execution, this means that some message carrying the effect of $o_1$ has already been delivered into replica of $o_2$. In state-based CRDT implementation, this message contains some state aware of $o_1$, while in operation-based CRDT implementation, this message is the message of $o_1$. Based on this intuition, when $(o_1,o_2) \in \mathit{vis}$, we assume that $o_1 \in \mathbb{U}$, since otherwise $o_1 \in \mathbb{Q}$ and has no side-effect.

\subsection{Sequential Specification}
\label{subsec:sequential specification}

A sequential specification intends to propose a linearizable explanation for distributed objects.

For objects of simple types, a sequential specification is a set of operation sequences. Normally, the sequential specification is defined by the pre-condition and post-conditions. For example, the following is the sequential specification for distributed counter, and is given as a set of transition rules between states. Each state contains a integer value. Transition rule $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$ $(\mathit{inc},\_,\_)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = i+1 \}$ indicates that $\mathit{inc}$ will increase the state by $1$. Here we use $\_$ to indicate an element whose value has no influence. Since this rule does not use operation identifier and object, it is safe to write $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$ $\mathit{inc}$ $\{ \mathit{state} = i+1 \}$ instead. Similarly for $\mathit{dec}$ and $\mathit{read}$ operations. We write $s {\xrightarrow{o}} s'$ to indicate one step of $o$ transition between states $s$ and $s'$ that satisfies some transition rule.

A sequence $(\ell_1,i_1,x) \cdot \ldots \cdot (\ell_k,i_k,x)$ is in sequential specification $\mathit{counter}_s$, if there exists state $s_k$, such that $s_0 {\xrightarrow{(\ell_1,i_1,x)}} \ldots {\xrightarrow{(\ell_k,i_k,x)}} s_k$, and $s_0$ is the initial state. For example, it is easy to see that $(\mathit{inc},\mathit{id}_1,x) \cdot (\mathit{inc},\mathit{id}_2,x) \cdot (\mathit{dec},\mathit{id}_3,x) \cdot (\mathit{read} \Rightarrow 1,\mathit{id}_4,x) \in \mathit{counter}_s$. Note that operations of one sequence of $\mathit{counter}_s$ must be of a same object. We also implicitly assume that each operation has a unique operation identifier.


\begin{example}[sequential specification of counter]
\label{definition:sequential specification of counter}
The sequential specification $\mathit{counter}_s$ of counter is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a integer with initial value $0$.

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$ $\mathit{inc}$ $\{ \mathit{state} = i+1 \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$ $\mathit{dec}$ $\{ \mathit{state} = i-1 \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow i)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = i \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

However, for objects of some types which are designed only for distributed system, such as multi-value register and OR-set, sequential specification in above style seems insufficient (we explain this in the next subsection). To solve this problem, in the transition rules of sequential specification, for some operations, we give them a additional argument which is a set of operation identifiers. Such additional argument essentially represents the operations visible to this operation. We use the sequential specification of multi-value register as example to explain this, which is shown below.

Each state contains a set of tuples $(a,\mathit{id},f)$, where $a$ is item, $\mathit{id}$ is the operation identifier of the operation that put this tuple, and $f$ indicates whether this item is logically removed or not. Given a state $S$, a $(write(a),\mathit{id},x)$ operation with argument $S_1$, the resulting state is obtained by marking all items in $S$ with $S_1$ identifiers into $\mathit{false}$, and then insert $(a,id,\mathit{true})$ into $S$. A $\mathit{read}$ operation returns value with flag $\mathit{true}$ in state.


\begin{example}[sequential specification of multi-value register]
\label{definition:sequential specification of multi-value register}
The sequential specification $\mathit{MVReg}_s$ of multi-value register is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its element $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$, a operation identifier $\mathit{id} \in \mathbb{O}$, and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$ $((write(a),\mathit{id},x),S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[(b,\mathit{id}_1) \in S_2 : \mathit{false}]
\cup
\{ (a,id,\mathit{true}) \}
\}$. Here $S_2 = \{ (b,\mathit{id}_1) \vert (b,\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{true}) \in S \wedge id \in S_1 \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{ a \vert (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $read() \Rightarrow S_1$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

Based on above intuition, let us introduce the notion of sequential specification. Let specification alphabet $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{OP} \cup \{ (o,s) \vert o \in \mathbb{OP}, s \subseteq \mathbb{OID} \}$. Then, a sequential specification of CRDT is defined as a set of sequences over specification alphabets $\mathbb{A}$.

%\gp{We should add the specifications (even non-deterministic here.)}
\begin{definition}[Sequential Specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification}
A sequential specification is a set of strings over specification alphabet $\mathbb{A}$.
\end{definition}

The methods that needs additional arguments, such as $\mathit{write}$ method of multi-value register and $\mathit{rem}$ method of OR-set, is called special methods of that specification. Given a sequential specification  A sequential specification is $\mathit{deterministic}$, if in each of its rules, from each state with each operation, there is at most one resulting state. Otherwise, it is a $\mathit{nondeterministic}$ specification. In the following we will introduce several types and their sequential specifications. $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, a version of list specification, is nondeterministic, while all other sequential specifications are deterministic.


\begin{example}[set and its sequential specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification of set}
A set has three methods: $\mathit{add}(a)$ inserts item $a$ into set; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ removes $a$ from set; and $\mathit{read}$ returns the set content. It implicitly assumes that each item being put into the set only once. The sequential specification $\mathit{set}_s$ of set is given as follows:  Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its element $(a,f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$ and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$.

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge a \notin S \}$ $\mathit{add}(a)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \cup \{ (a,\mathit{true}) \} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge (a,\_) \in S \}$ $\mathit{rem}(a)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[a:\mathit{false}] \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{a \vert (a,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}



\begin{example}[OR-set and its sequential specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification of or-set}
OR-set is essential a multi-set: $\mathit{add}(a)$ inserts an item $a$ into multi-set; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ cancels only items $a$ that are inserted by $\mathit{add}(a)$ operations visible to this remove operation; $\mathit{read}$ returns the set of items in multi-set. A value can be inserted multiple times.

The sequential specification $\mathit{OR}$-$\mathit{set}_s$ of OR-set is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a set and each its element $(a,\mathit{id},f)$ is a tuple of a data $a$, a operation identifier $\mathit{id} \in \mathbb{O}$, and a flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$. In $((rem(a),\mathit{id}'),S_1)$, $S_1$ represents the operations visible to this remove operation.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S  \wedge (\_,\mathit{id},\_) \notin S \}$ $(\mathit{add}(a),\mathit{id})$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \cup \{ (a,\mathit{id},\mathit{true}) \} \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \wedge S_1 = \{ a \vert (a,\_,\mathit{true}) \in S \} \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = S \}$ $((rem(a),\_,\_),S_1)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = S[(b,\mathit{id}_1) \in S_2 : \mathit{false}] \}$. Here $S_2 = \{ (b,\mathit{id}_1) \vert (b,\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{true}) \in S \wedge id \in S_1 \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}


\begin{example}[register and its sequential specification]
\label{definition:sequential specification of register}
A register has two methods: $\mathit{write}(a)$ writes $a$ into register; $\mathit{read}$ returns the value of register. The sequential specification $\mathit{reg}_s$ of register is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state} \in \mathbb{D}$ be a value.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = a  \}$ $\mathit{write}(b)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = b \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = a \}$ $(\mathit{read}() \Rightarrow a)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = a \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}




\begin{example}[List with add-after interface]
\label{definition:sequential specification of list with add-after interface}
Assume each item of the list is unique. A list has three methods: $\mathit{add}(b,a)$ inserts item $b$ into the list at the position immediately after that of item $a$; $\mathit{rem}(a)$ removes item $a$ from the list; and $\mathit{read}$ returns the list content. We assume that the initial value of list is $(\circ,\mathit{true})$ and this node can not be removed. We use the word ``add-after'' to emphasize the method $\mathit{add}(b,a)$, which is different from the other list interface that uses method $\mathit{add}(b,a,c)$.

The sequential specification $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{af}}$ of list is given as follows: Let $\mathit{state}$ be a sequence, where each item is a tuple $(a,f)$ with data $a$ and flag $f \in \{ \mathit{true},\mathit{false} \}$. Here $\mathit{af}$ represents add-after, and we use $l \uparrow_{S}$ to represent the projection of sequence $l$ into set $S$. When the context is clear, in $\mathit{read}$ operation, we will omit $\circ$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \wedge l \leq n \wedge b \notin \{ a_1, \ldots, a_n \} \}$ $add(b,a_l)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_l,f_l) \cdot (b,\mathit{true}) \cdot (a_{l+1},f_{l+1}) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \}$.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \wedge S = \{ a \vert (a,\mathit{true}) \in \mathit{state} \} \wedge l = a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n \uparrow_{S} \}$ $(read() \Rightarrow l)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}



\begin{example}[List with add-between interface]
\label{definition:sequential specification of list with add-after interface}
Such kind of list is similar as list with add-after interface. One difference is the $\mathit{add}$ method: $\mathit{add}(b,a,c)$ inserts item $b$ into the list at some nondeterministic position between position of $a$ and position of $c$. The other difference is that, we assume that the initial value of list is $(\circ_1,\mathit{true}) \cdot (\circ_2,\mathit{true})$ and these two nodes can not be removed. The sequential specification $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$ of list is given as follows: Here $\mathit{ab}$ represents add-between. When the context is clear, in $\mathit{read}$ operation, we will omit $\circ_1$ and $\circ_2$.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5pt}
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \wedge k < m < l \wedge b \notin \{ a_1, \ldots, a_n \} \}$ $add(b,a_k,a_l)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_m,f_m) \cdot (b,\mathit{true}) \cdot (a_{m+1},f_{m+1}) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \}$. Here the chosen of $m$ is deterministic.
\item[-] $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \wedge S = \{ a \vert (a,\mathit{true}) \in \mathit{state} \} \wedge l = a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n \uparrow_{S} \}$ $(read() \Rightarrow l)$ $\{ \mathit{state} = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_n,f_n) \}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}







\subsection{Definition of Distributed Linearizability}
\label{subsec:definition of distributed linearizability}

A history is single-object, if it contains operations of a single object. A history is multi-object, if it contains operations of multiple objects. In the following we propose distributed linearizability for histories.


\begin{definition}[Distributed Linearizability]
\label{definition:distributed linearizability}

A single-object history $h = (\mathit{Op},\mathit{ro},\mathit{vis})$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t a deterministic sequential specification $\mathit{spec}$, if there exists a sequence $\mathit{lin}$, called linearization of $h$, such that

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The elements of $\mathit{lin}$ is generated from the operations of $h$: for operation $o$ of special methods, $\mathit{lin}$ uses $(o,\mathit{vis}^{-1}(o))$; while for other operation $o$, $\mathit{lin}$ uses $o$.
\item $\mathit{lin}$ is consistent with $\mathit{vis}$,
\item the projection of $\mathit{lin}$ into update operations is in $\mathit{spec}$,
\item For each query operation $o$, $\mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathit{vis}^{-1}(o)  } \cdot o \in \mathit{spec}$.
\end{enumerate}

A multi-object history $h$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t deterministic sequential specifications, if for each object $x$, $h \uparrow_{x}$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t its sequential specification. A set $H$ of histories are distributed linearizable w.r.t deterministic sequential specifications, if each of its history is.
\end{definition}

$h \uparrow_{x}$ is obtained from $h$ by projecting the operations and relations into operations of object $x$. Here the linearization gives a global and linearizable explanation of all operations. With sequential specification and linearization of the history, the understanding of distributed behaviors should be simplified. The linearization can be also considered as a guide to the conflict resolution.

\figurename~\ref{fig:a distributed linearizable history} is a history of OR-set. Here subscript of $\mathit{add}_1(a)$ is used to distinguish different $\mathit{add}(a)$ operations, and similarly for $\mathit{read}_1() \Rightarrow \{ a,b \}$. This history is distributed linearizable. To explain this, let the operation identifiers of operations of the first replica (resp., of the second replica) be $\mathit{id}_1,\mathit{id}_2,\mathit{id}_3,\mathit{id}_4$ (resp., $\mathit{id}_5,\mathit{id}_6,\mathit{id}_7,\mathit{id}_8$), in the replica order, respectively. The linearization of this history is $\mathit{add}_1(a) \cdot \mathit{add}_1(b) \cdot \mathit{add}_2(b) \cdot \mathit{add}_2(a) \cdot ((\mathit{rem}(b),\_,\_),\{ \mathit{id}_1, \mathit{id}_2 \}) \cdot ((\mathit{rem}(a),\_,\_),\{ \mathit{id}_5, \mathit{id}_6 \}) \cdot ((\mathit{read}_1 \Rightarrow \{ a,b \},\_,\_), S ) \cdot ((\mathit{read}_2 \Rightarrow \{ a,b \},\_,\_), S )$, where $S = \{ \mathit{id}_1, \mathit{id}_2, \mathit{id}_3, \mathit{id}_5, \mathit{id}_6, \mathit{id}_7 \}$.

The history of \figurename~\ref{fig:a distributed linearizable history} is distributed linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{OR}$-$\mathit{set}_s$, but not $\mathit{set}_s$. Assume that by contradiction, this history is linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{set}_s$ and $\mathit{lin}$ is its linearization. Then it is obvious that to ensure $b$ be in the return value of $\mathit{read}_1$, we should put $\mathit{add}_1(b)$ after $\mathit{rem}(b)$ in $\mathit{lin}$; then $\mathit{add}_2(a)$ is after $\mathit{add}_1(b)$ in in $\mathit{lin}$, and $\mathit{rem}(a)$ is after $\mathit{add}_2(a)$ in in $\mathit{lin}$. However, this makes $a$ not in return value of $\mathit{read}_2$ according to $\mathit{set}_s$, which introduces contradiction. Therefore, it seems quite difficult to have a sequential specification of OR-set without using special methods.

\end{figure}

\figurename~\ref{fig:a non-distributed linearizable history} is a history of list with add-after interface. It is not distributed linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{af}}$, since the operation $\mathit{read} \Rightarrow a \cdot b \cdot c$ can not be validated. By enumerating all possible linearizations, the only possible valid return value of this $\mathit{read}$ operation are $a \cdot c \cdot b$ and $b \cdot a \cdot c$.

\end{figure}

We say a history satisfy convergence, if given query operations $o_1$ and $o_2$ of this history, if $o_1$ and $o_2$ see the same set of update operations, then they observe from ``a same abstract state''. Or we can say, when such $o_1$ and $o_2$ are of same method, they should return same value. By definition \ref{definition:distributed linearizability}, our distributed linearizability for deterministic sequential specification obviously implies convergence. However, this does not holds when we consider nondeterministic sequential specification. One example is shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:a non-convergent history}. It is easy to see that this history is distributed linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$. Two $\mathit{read}$ operations both see $\mathit{add}(a,\circ_1,\circ_2)$ and $\mathit{add}(b,\circ_1,\circ_2)$. However, one of them decide to put $a$ before $b$, and the other decide to put $b$ before $a$, and this implies non-convergence.

\end{figure}



Intuitively, we intends to use linearization to do conflict resolution. This works well for deterministic sequential specification. However, when the sequential specification becomes nondeterministic, linearization is not enough to do conflict resolution. This is the reason for this anomaly. Note that a nondeterministic sequential specification, such as $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, does not mean that in algorithm they choose random position for an item or they do conflict resolution in a random style. For example, in latter section we will see that a list algorithm called WOOT is distributed linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, while WOOT ensures convergence. The reason for using $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$ for WOOT is that: in $\mathit{add}(b,a,c)$ method of WOOT, the position of item $b$ is determined by some associated detailed information of item $b$ which is too detail for specification; and the position of $b$ is neither the immediate position after that of $a$, or the position immediate before that of $c$.

To deal with nondeterministic sequential specification, we added an additionally condition in distributed linearization definition: Let $s_0$ be the initial state of sequential specification,

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item For each query operation $o$, if $s_0 {\xrightarrow{ \mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathit{vis}^{-1}(o)  } \cdot o }} s$, and $s_0 {\xrightarrow{ \mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathbb{U} } } } s'$, then $s$ is a ``sub-state'' of $s'$.
\end{enumerate}

For $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$ we interpret this condition as: If $s = (a_1,f_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a_k,b_k)$ and $s' = (a'_1,f'_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (a'_n,f'_n)$, then $a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_k$ is a sub-sequence of $a'_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a'_n$. The following lemma states that our distributed linearizability implies convergence. It holds for $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, since our additional condition ensure that if two $\mathit{read}$ operation sees same set of $\mathit{add}$ and $\mathit{rem}$ operations, then their local state must be the same.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:distributed linarizability implies convergence}
If a history $h$ is distributed linearizability w.r.t deterministic sequential specification or $\mathit{list}_s^{\mathit{ab}}$, then $h$ satisfies convergence.
\end{lemma}
