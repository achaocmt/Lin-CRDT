\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we consider the problem of the specification and
  verification of Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).
  %
  We provide a new specification and correctness criterion for CRDTs
  akin to Linearizability as defined by~\cite{HerlihyW90}.
  %
  We argue that this criterion is both simple to understand, and it
  fits most well known implementations of known CRDTs.
  %
  Then we show how to prove that CRDT implementations can be
  formally proved to be correct w.r.t. their specification.
  %
  In particular, we do so for many well known implementations taken
  from~\cite{ShapiroPBZ11}.
  %
  We conclude the paper by showing how our criterion can be leveraged
  to reason modularly about the composition of CRDTs.
