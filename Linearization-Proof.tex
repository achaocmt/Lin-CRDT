\section{Proving Distributed Linearizability}
\label{sec:proving distributed linearizability} 

First, we propose a function $f$ from state to history, and a function $g$ from history to linearization. Such function $f$ and $g$ holds when distributed system proceed. Then, we prove that such linearization is in specification. We also need a invariant of states.
