\subsection{System Model}
\label{sec:sys-model}


\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
% \begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.9]{figures/sys-mod}
  \caption{CRDT System Model}
  \label{fig:sys-mod}
% \end{figure}
\end{wrapfigure}
We assume that the system is comprised of multiple nodes in a network.
In this work we will be concerned with the implementation of CRDTs,
and we will usually concentrate our discussion to the behaviors
allowed for \emph{an instance} of the data type.
We will generically call such an instance an \emph{object}.
As mentioned in~\autoref{sec:introduction} we assume that objects are
replicated among the participating nodes of the system -- which we
shall call replicas.

% \gpwarning{Redraw pictures.}
The execution model for an operation \lstinline|op(v)| on a replicated
object is depicted in~\autoref{fig:sys-mod} and it proceeds as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item A client, which is a program issuing calls to the object, connects
  to any one replica (a node of the system holding a copy of the object)
  and performs the operation in that replica, we shall call such a
  replica the \emph{source} or origin. The source of \lstinline|op(v)|
  in~\autoref{fig:sys-mod} is the replica on the top: $\arep_1$.
\item Then, executing an operation is done in two phases.
  Assuming that the operation requires reading and updating the state
  of the object, the state of the object in the source replica is read
  first.
  We shall sometimes refer to this part of the operation as the
  \emph{generator} following~\cite{ShapiroPBZ11}.
  Then, if the state needs to be changed as part of the operation --
  e.g. an \lstinline|addRight| operation of RGA -- an update is
  generated which shall be executed in all the replicas holding copies of the
  object.
  We shall refer to the update as the \emph{effector}.
  We assume throughout this paper that effectors are executed
  immediate in the source replica.
  This is represented by the dot at the source replica
  in~\autoref{fig:sys-mod}.
\item Finally, as the system progresses, the effector of the operation
  will be delivered to each of the replicas holding a copy of the
  object, and the state of each of the replicas will be updated
  consequently.
  This is represented by the target of the arrows
  in~\autoref{fig:sys-mod}.
\end{itemize}
% This model is depicted in~\autoref{fig:system-model}.
% \fxwarning[nomargin, inline]{We need the picture}.

\paragraph{CRDT implementations}

Following the description above, \citet{ShapiroPBZ11} presents the code
for a number of CRDT implementations.
%
Here we consider the code of the RGA algorithm presented
in~\autoref{lst:rga}, where we ignore the lines starting with the
annotation \lstinline|//@| for the moment.
%
Let us first consider the structure of the data type implementation:
\begin{itemize}
\item The keyword \lstinline|payload| introduces the state that is
  used to represent the object. This is akin to the fields of a class
  file in an object oriented language such as Java. In the specific
  case of RGA we have a variable \lstinline|N| of type
  \lstinline|Ti-Tree| (to be discussed later), and a variable
  \lstinline|Tomb| of type \lstinline|Set|.
\item After that we find the definitions of the three operations we
  discussed in the introduction: \lstinline|addAfter|,
  \lstinline|remove| and \lstinline|read|.
\item The effectful operations \lstinline|addAfter| and
  \lstinline|remove| have two labels marked in red:
  \lstinline|atSource| and \lstinline|downStream|.
  These represent the code to be executed as the generator and
  effector respectively. Hence, the code under the label
  \lstinline|atSource| is executed only at the source replica and it
  generates the arguments that the code under \lstinline|downStream|
  will execute in each of the replicas (including the source).
\item We can also notice that under the labels there are
  \lstinline|precondition| annotations indicating facts that are
  assumed about the state of the object upon execution of either of
  the generator or effector of the operation.
\end{itemize}
Reconsidering~\autoref{fig:sys-mod} we can say that the
source of the arrows in a replica represents the execution of an
\lstinline|atSource| jointly with the \lstinline|downStream| of the
operation at the source replica.
%
The target of the arrows represents the delivery and execution of the
effector of the operation in a replica other than the source.


In the rest of this section we consider two examples of CRDT
implementations and their linearization arguments.

\subsection{RGA CRDT Implementation}
\label{sec:rga-crdt-impl}

% \paragraph{RGA CRDT implementation}
As it is common to many CRDT implementations, in RGA replicas will use
a timestamp mechanism to keep track of the causality between updates
to the list, effectively capturing when two updates are concurrent.
Moreover, they will keep the information relating the causal order
in which elements are added to the list.
%
Provided with this causality information -- or lack thereof--, the
timestamps will be used to resolve conflicts in a deterministic way.
%
More concretely, each replica will keep what we shall name a
\emph{Timestamp Tree} (\lstinline|Ti-Tree|) containing in every tree
node a pair with: the element added to the list (for instance the
character \lstinline|b|), and a timestamp associated to it
(\lstinline|t|$_{\mathtt{b}}$) which will be used to resolve
conflicts.
%
We will encode the tree as a set containing triples (corresponding to
nodes) of the form (\lstinline|a|, \lstinline|ts|$_{\mathtt{b}}$, \lstinline|b|)
representing the fact that there is an element \lstinline|b| in the
tree with timestamp \lstinline|ts|$_{\mathtt{b}}$ and whose parent is the item
\lstinline|a| also present in the tree.
%
The tree-ness property will be ensured by construction.


% \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.3\textwidth}
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[scale=.9]{figures/simple-ti-tree}
%   \caption{RGA Ti-tree example.}
%   \label{fig:rga-tree}
% \end{wrapfigure}
If we look at the \lstinline|atSource| portion of the
\lstinline|addAfter(a,b)| method we can see that precondition requires
the element \lstinline|a| to exist in the tree before the insertion of
\lstinline|b| after it.
%
We remark at this point that the data structure is initialized with a
preexisting initial element denoted by $\circ$.
%
The generator then samples a timestamp \lstinline|t|$_{\mathtt{b}}$
for \lstinline|b| which is assumed to be larger than any
timestamp presently occurring in the \lstinline|Ti-Tree|
\lstinline|N|.
\gpnote{Add note about uniqueness of TSs (rid).}
%
Looking at the \lstinline|downStream| portion of
\lstinline|addAfter(a,b)| we see that the effect of the operation is
to add the triple \lstinline|(a, ts|$_{\mathtt{b}}$\lstinline|, b)|
in the replicas own copy of \lstinline|N|.
%
This ensures that the tree structure is consistent with the causality
of insertions in the data structure.
%
Notice that a client of the object will only ever attempt to add an
element after another element which it has already seen as mandated by
the \lstinline|addAfter| API.
%
Hence, the parent node of any node was inserted before it, and is
causally related to it.
%
Similarly, nodes that are not related to each other on any path of
the tree (eg. siblings) are not related causally related.
% \footnote{The converse
%   is not true. There can be nodes that are linked by ancestry in the
%   tree resulting from concurrent operations, but this does not affect
%   the correctness of the algorithm.}
%
An example of such a tree is shown in the left most box
of~\autoref{fig:rga-trace}, where we can see that
elements \lstinline|c| and \lstinline|b| were concurrently added after
\lstinline|a|, and \lstinline|a| was added first after the
initialization element $\circ$.

Considering a \lstinline|Ti-tree| constructed in this way, we can
obtain a list by traversing the tree in pre-order fashion, with the
proviso that siblings are ordered according to their timestamps with
the \emph{highest timestamp visited first}.
%
Again, the leftmost box in~\autoref{fig:rga-trace} shows a tree that
results in the list $\mathtt{a \cdot b \cdot c}$ assuming that the
timestamp order is $\mathtt{ts_a < ts_c < ts_b}$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/RGA-Trace}
% \vspace{-10pt}
  \caption{Example of RGA conflict resolution.}
  \label{fig:rga-trace}
\end{figure}

Let us now consider the case of two concurrent operations:
\lstinline|addAfter(c,d)| and \lstinline|addAfter(c,e)| executing in
two different replicas.
%
Following the code in~\autoref{lst:rga} we obtain the trees in the
second column of~\autoref{fig:rga-trace} where we assume that the
top tree is the result of \lstinline|addAfter(c,d)| in one of the
replicas, and the bottom tree is the result of executing
\lstinline|addAfter(c,e)| in the other replica.
%
As it can be seen, the two trees result in different lists in each
replicas before the operations are propagated respectively.
%
In the third column of~\autoref{fig:rga-trace} we obtain the
result of propagating the operations between the replicas -- indeed
the propagation of any of the operations to any of the replicas
engenders this tree, since the result would be the same (c.f. CRDT).
%
It is clear now that the result of the list is $\mathtt{a \cdot b
  \cdot c \cdot d \cdot e}$.


% \gpnote*{By Chao. Should be elsewhere}{
% \figurename~\ref{fig:how RGA works} gives a example of how RGA do conflict resolution for concurrent $addAfter$ operations, and how it do $remove$: if from one local state we do concurrent $\alabelshort[addAfter]{b,c}$ and $\alabelshort[addAfter]{b,d}$, then it converges. If we then do $\alabelshort[remove]{b}$, we just add $b$ into tombstone. Here we assume $\ats_a$, $\ats_b$, $\ats_c$ and $\ats_d$ is the timestamp of $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, respectively, and the timestamp order be $\ats_a < \ats_b < \ats_c < \ats_d$.
% }

We have so far ignored the \lstinline|remove| operation.
%
Consider the case where a client issues an \lstinline|addAfter(a, b)|
on a replica whereas another client issues a \lstinline|remove(a)|
operation in another replica.
%
If the effector of \lstinline|remove(a)| reaches every replica after
the effector of \lstinline|addAfter(a, b)| there is no problem since
the semantics is obvious (the element \lstinline|a| is removed after
the element \lstinline|b| has been added).
%
However, if the operations reach some replica in the opposite order
(recall that these are concurrent operations) we have a problem, since
the precondition of the effector of \lstinline|addAfter(a, b)|
requires that the element \lstinline|a| be present in the
\lstinline|Ti-tree| of the replica.

To avoid this kind of conflict, thus rendering these operations
commutative (c.f. CRDT), RGA does not really erase elements from the
\lstinline|Ti-tree|.
%
Instead, an additional data structure called a tombstone is used to
keep track of elements that have been conceptually erased and should
not be considered when reading the data structure with the
\lstinline|read| operation.
%
In our case the tombstone is simply a set \lstinline|Tomb| of
elements.
%
With this explanation the code of the \lstinline|remove| operation
in~\autoref{lst:rga} should be self-explanatory.
%
The last column of~\autoref{fig:rga-trace} shows the result of
removing item $\mathtt{d}$ from the list.

Then, the implementation of \lstinline|read| performs the pre-order
traversal as explained before, where all the elements in the tombstone
\lstinline|Tomb| are ignored from the output list.
%
In each of the boxes of~\autoref{fig:rga-trace} the list shown
represents the result of a \lstinline|read| operation in the state
depicted.

% \fxwarning[nomargin, inline]{It's not clear what we are linearizing. I think we should say that standard linearizability considers the partial order given by real-time while here we consider the visibility relation}

% \fxwarning[nomargin, inline]{We should already explain the issue of queries, the fact that RGA is not linearizable in the classical sense.}

\paragraph{Operations, histories and linearizability}
Let us now consider a more abstract view of executions of a concurrent
data type object.
%
The de-facto correctness condition of concurrent data structure
implementations is \emph{linearizability}~\cite{HerlihyW90}.
%
Linearizability requires that for any execution of an object of the
data type in question, there must exists an ``equivalent linear''
execution where each of the operations sees the effects of all
operations prior to it.
%
The notion of equivalent here requires that the set of executed
operations are the same -- that is the method, arguments, and return
value of each operation are preserved.
%
Then, linearizability requires that whenever two operations are
sequentially ordered by the client code executing them, they should
appear in the linear ordering in that order.
%
A final constraint imposed by linearizability, sometimes referred to
as real-time order, is that whenever an operation returns at a time
prior to which another operation (concurrent or not) starts, then
these operations must respect this order in the linearization.
%

To make these notions precise without referring to implementation
details we will consider \emph{execution histories}.
%
Informally a history is a set of operations with a partial order
representing the ordering constraints imposed on the execution of each
of the operations.
%
We will represent the execution of an operation with a label of the
form $\alabellong{\argv}{\retv}$ representing a call to method
$\amethod$ with arguments $\argv$ and whose return value is $\retv$.
%
When the values are unimportant we shall use the meta-variable
$\alabel$ to denote a label.
%
We can assume here that each of these labels is uniquely identified.
%
Then, an execution history is a pair $(\alabelset, <)$ containing a
set of labels $\alabelset$ and a partial order $<$ between labels
incorporating the constraints enforced by the execution.
%
For instance, in the case of linearizability as in~\cite{HerlihyW90}
the order $<$ relates two operations originating from the same process
as well as any two operations the first of which terminated before the
other one started.

Then, the linearizability requirement for an execution history
$(\alabelset, <)$ is that there exists a \emph{sequential execution}
history $(\alabelset, <_{\mathsf{seq}})$ such that
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item $(\alabelset, <)$ is a valid execution of the object,
\item $<_{\mathsf{seq}}$ is a total order of the operations in
  $\alabelset$, and
\item $ <\ \subseteq\ <_{\mathsf{seq}}$.
\end{inparaenum}

While linearizability is an adequate correctness criterion for
systems with strong synchronization assumptions (for instance
shared-memory systems), it is not adequate for unreliable distributed
systems.
%
In the specific case of CRDTs, we need to accommodate for the fact
that operations are propagated lazily, so two replicas can see
non-coinciding sets of operations.
%
Hence we relax linearizability to adapt it to CRDTs.
%
Our relaxations requires that the linear execution be consistent with
the visibility relation among operations, where we say that an
operation with label $\alabel_1$ is visible to another operation
with label $\alabel_2$ if at the time when $\alabel_2$ was
first executed, the effects of $\alabel_1$ where incorporated in
the replica executing $\alabel_2$.
%
Moreover, we will allow operations that read the state of the object
to see a sub-sequence of the linearization.
%
Let us illustrate these intuitions through examples.

% %
% That is, that there exists a total order of the operations such that
% the result of each operation corresponds to the execution of all the
% operations prior to it in the order (c.f.
% linearizability~\cite{HerlihyW90}).
% %

\paragraph{Intuition of RGA \CRDTLinshort{}}
To simplify the argument which will be made precise in the following
section we focus first on the linearization of two concurrent
operations adding an element after a common element.
%
Let us say that we have two concurrent \lstinline|addAfter(a,b)| and
\lstinline|addAfter(a,c)| operations.
%
Because these operations are concurrent they are not related by
visibility (by definition of concurrent) so our criterion allows for
any ordering among them.
%
Can we show that these operations can always be ordered one way or
another such that the result of all subsequent reads will correspond
to this ordering?
%
In fact, from the explanation given above we know that the order
between \lstinline|b| and \lstinline|c| in the resulting list will be
determined by their corresponding timestamps
(\lstinline|t|$_{\mathtt{b}}$ and \lstinline|t|$_{\mathtt{c}}$).
%
Assuming that the ordering is the one given in the tree of the first
column of~\autoref{fig:rga-trace} we know that we can order the
operations as \lstinline|addAfter(a, c)| followed by
\lstinline|addAfter(a, b)| which when executed sequentially obviously
results in $\mathtt{a \cdot b \cdot c}$ as shown in the picture.
%
The critical observation here is that the timestamp metadata if RGA
gives us a strategy to build the sequence of operations that
corresponds to a sequential specification.
%
A concrete linearization of these operations would be given by the
sequence:
\[\alabellong[\mathtt{addAfter}]{\circ,a}{\bot}\ \cdot\
\alabellong[\mathtt{addAfter}]{a,c}{\bot}\ \cdot\
\alabellong[\mathtt{addAfter}]{a,b}{\bot}\ \cdot\
\]
where we denote by $\bot$ the fact that the method $\mathtt{addAfter}$
does not return any value.

We have shown an example above where two $\mathtt{addAfter}$
operations can be linearized.
%
Unfortunately we cannot show that this linearization works for any set
of operations.
%
Consider now a similar case where after issuing the
$\mathtt{addAfter}$ operations the processes attempt to immediately
read the state.
%
As it was explained in~\autoref{fig:rga-trace} a possible behavior is
that the first process returns the list $\mathtt{\circ \cdot a \cdot
  b}$ while the second returns the list $\mathtt{\circ \cdot a \cdot
  c}$. 
%
If we consider the linearization given for the $\mathtt{addAfter}$
methods above, the result $\mathtt{\circ \cdot a \cdot b}$ is not
possible, since before $\mathtt{b}$ was added $\mathtt{c}$ was added.
%
The problem here is that the replica executing this read has not yet
seen the effect of the call to $\mathtt{addAfter(a, c)}$.
%
To overcome this problem we allow methods that read the state to see a
sub-sequence of the global linearization of the methods.
%
Hence, we can now consider the linearization 
\[
  \begin{array}{c}
    \alabellong[\mathtt{addAfter}]{\circ,a}{\bot}\ \cdot\
    {\color{red} \alabellong[\mathtt{addAfter}]{a,c}{\bot}}\ \cdot \kern5cm\\    
    \hspace{\hfill} \alabellong[\mathtt{read}]{}{(\circ \cdot\ a \cdot c)}\ \cdot\
    \alabellong[\mathtt{addAfter}]{a,b}{\bot}\ \cdot\
    \alabellong[\mathtt{read}]{}{(\circ \cdot\ a \cdot b)}
  \end{array}
\]
where the last call to $\mathtt{read}$ ignores the label
$\mathtt{addAfter}(a, c)$ marked in red color.

While these are only two of the cases of conflicting concurrent
operations, in~\autoref{sec:proofs} we show that all operations
can be order in such a way that they correspond to a sequential
execution thereof.

% In RGA algorithm, a replica store the list as a timestamp insertion
% tree (TI-tree) $N$, and stores the deleted items in tombstone
% $\mathit{Tomb}$. A TI-tree $N$ is a set of tuples $(a,t,p)$, where
% $a$ is a item, $t$ is its unique time-stamp, and $p$ is the
% time-stamp of its ``parent'' node. Each time-stamp is a tuple
% $(c,r)$ with $c \in \mathbb{N}$ and $r \in \mathbb{R}$. A total
% order $<_{\mathit{ts}}$ between time-stamps is defined, such that
% $(c_1,r_1) <_{\mathit{ts}} (c_2,r_2)$, if $c_1 < c_2 \vee (c_1 = c_2
% \wedge r_1 <_r r_2)$, where $<_r$ is a total-order over
% $\mathbb{R}$. There is a pre-existed item $\circ$ of TI-tree with
% time stamp $(0,r_0)$, which are considered as the root of the tree.
% Each element of $N$ should have unique item and time stamp, and the
% elements of $N$ are required to form a tree by following the parent
% field. The tombstone $\mathit{Tomb}$ is a set of items and records
% items been removed from the list.

  \includegraphics[width=0.45 \textwidth]{./figures/OR-Set-simple}
  \caption{Interleaving-based Set}
  \label{fig:or-set-simple}
\end{wrapfigure}
The Observed-Remove Set (OR-Set) is another CRDT~\cite{ShapiroPBZ11},
this time implementing a Set interface with methods: \lstinline|add(a)|,
\lstinline|remove(a)| and \lstinline|read()|.\footnote{Alternatively
  we could provide an interface with the method \lstinline|lookup(a)|
  returning a boolean with the same consequences as the
  \lstinline|read()|. This choice is of no consequence to our results.}
%

The meaning of these methods is self-evident from their names.
%
However, what is not evident is what are the results of conflicting
concurrent operations.
%
Consider for example the case where two replicas add a certain element
\lstinline|a| and then one of them removes that element.
%
If we consider an interleaving based execution of these operations
there are two options depending on the interleaving:
\begin{inparaenum}[i)]
\item if the \lstinline|remove(a)| operation is the last operation
  then the expected set is empty, since the two consecutive
  \lstinline|add(a)| operations are idempotent, and the
  \lstinline|remove| would remove the only occurrence of
  \lstinline|a|. This interleaving is the one depicted with solid
  arrows in~\autoref{fig:or-set-simple}.
\item On the other hand, if the operation \lstinline|add(a)| of the
  non-removing process comes last as depicted with the dashed arrows
  in~\autoref{fig:or-set-simple}, the final set could contain the
  element \lstinline|a|.
\end{inparaenum}
As we have explained before, in our system model the operations can
arrive in one order to one replica and in a different order to another
replica.
%
To guarantee convergence, OR-Set must ensure that regardless of the
ordering, the resulting set will be the same.
%
To that end, OR-Set \lstinline|add| operations will tag each added
element with a unique identifier.
%
Then, a remove operation will only remove the elements which has
already seen.
%
For instance, in the example above, the remove of \lstinline|a| will
only remove the element that has been previously added by the same
replica, since this item as been observed by the \lstinline|remove|
operation -- and thus its identifier is known to it --. However, the
concurrent \lstinline|add(a)| operation will have an identifier that
has not been observed by the \lstinline|remove| (since they are
concurrent).
%
Therefore the item will not be removed, even in the case where the
effectors of the two adds are performed in a replica before the effector
of the remove.
%
The code of OR-Set is shown in~\autoref{lst:or-set} where for the time
being we ignore the lines marked with \lstinline|//@| annotations.

It is easy to find examples where the implementation of OR-Set can
produce executions which cannot be justified by standard definition of
linearizability (they are not even sequentializable)
of~\citet{HerlihyW90} assuming a standard Set specification.
%
% \gpwarning{Redraw this picture properly.}
\autoref{fig:or-set-not-lin} shows one such example.
%
For simplicity we assume here that we have two clients, each executing
in one of two replicas as their source, issuing the sequences of
operations \lstinline|add(b);add(a);remove(b);read()| and
\lstinline|add(a);add(b);remove(a);read()| respectively.
%
The final reads are added only to exhibit the final state as perceived by
each replica through the API of the object.
%
Clearly any linearization a la~\citet{HerlihyW90} should end with a
\lstinline|remove| operation, and therefore the final set should have
at most one element. Contrary to that, in the final set we obtain:
\{\lstinline|a, b|\} as observed by the result of the final
\lstinline|read| operations.
%
% In other words, if in any of the replicas a \lstinline|read()|
% operation were to be issued, the result would be the set
% \{\lstinline|a, b|\} .

For our definition of \CRDTLinshort{} we will distinguish between
\emph{update} and \emph{query} operations.
%
We will impose two constraints, one on updates and another one on
queries:
\begin{itemize}
\item For updates we require that there exists a total order of all
  the updates in the execution -- essentially a linearization -- such
  that the resulting state of the object -- or any intermediate state --
  can be explained by executing the \emph{specification} of these
  updates in order.
%
  Essentially, reachable states of the implementation are related to
  specification states that can be reached by a certain global
  linearization of the updates.
%
  \gpnote{Example?}
\item Unfortunately, this simple requirement does not suffice for
  query operations, since the system model allows for updates to arrive
  to different replicas in different order.
%
  Hence, for \CRDTLinshort{} we will require that the result of any
  query can be explained by consider a \emph{sub-sequence} of the above
  mentioned global linearization of updates.
\end{itemize}
This definition will be made precise in~\autoref{sec:distributed-lin}.

\gpnote{Maybe add a read example first?}
Coming back to our OR-Set example in~\autoref{fig:or-set-not-lin}, we
have that the \lstinline|remove| operation behaves as both a query
(observing a certain number of updates on the element to be removed)
and an update (by removing said updates).
%
To cope with such cases, we will consider in our definition that
query-update operations can be split into a query part, which only
reads the state -- and hence is allowed to see a sub-sequence of the
linearization of updates --, and an update part which will use the
results of the prior query.
%
For instance, \lstinline|remove| will be split into a query part where
only the elements that are visible at the time of the remove are
selected, and an update part where only those elements selected are
erased.
%
Evidently, this requires some mechanism for ``marking'' the adds that
are concerned.
%
We will consider that each add has a unique identifier.
%
Then, the query part of a remove returns a set of unique identifiers
to be removed.
%
Any identifier not in this set will remain in the set after the update
part of the remove.
%
\autoref{fig:or-set-lk-rem} shows this rewriting
where we denote by \lstinline|lk| (for lookup) the query part of
remove, which returns a set of elements to be removed, and a
\lstinline|remove| operation taking a set of elements to be removed.
%
In this case, our definition of linearizability is just as before.
%
To linearize this execution, when contemplating only the updates, we
can chose any order consistent with the order in which operations are
performed in each replica and the result is consistent with the
specification of Set.
%
We discuss the details of this constructions in the next section.


% Method $\mathit{add}(a,b)$ intends to add item $a$ into the list at a
% position immediately after that of a existing item $b$. Method
% $\mathit{rem}(a)$ removes $a$ from the list. Method $\mathit{read}$
% returns the current list content. When the current replica does
% $\mathit{add}(a,b)$, it generate a tuple $(a,ts_a,ts_b)$ and put it
% into $N$. Here $ts_b$ is the time-stamp of $b$, and $ts_a$ is a new
% time-stamp that is larger than any time stamp in $N$. When the current
% replica does $\mathit{rem}(a)$, it put $a$ into tombstone. When the
% current replica does $\mathit{read}$, it uses function
% $\mathit{trans}(N,\mathit{Tomb})$ to return the list seen by the
% current replica, which is a sequences obtained by traversing $N$ in
% prefix order (children are visited in decreasing time-stamp order) and
% keeping only items that are not in $\mathit{Tomb}$.
