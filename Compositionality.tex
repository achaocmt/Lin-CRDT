\section{Compositionality of Distributed Linearizability}
\label{sec:compositionality of distributed linearizability}

The following is the definition of distributed linearizability for multi-object histories. 

\begin{definition}[Distributed Linearizability for Multi-object Histories]
\label{definition:distributed linearizability for multi-object histories} 
A history $h$ of multiple objects is distributed linearizabile, if there exists a sequence $\mathit{lin}$, called linearization of $h$, such that

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The elements of $\mathit{lin}$ is generated from the operations of $h$: each operation $o = (m(a) \Rightarrow b,i,\mathit{obj})$ is transformed into $(m(a) \Rightarrow b,i,S)$ with $S$ set of identifiers of operations of visible to $o$ via $h.\mathit{vis}$. 
\item $\mathit{lin}$ is consistent with $h. \mathit{vis}$.
\item For each object $\mathit{obj}$, $h \uparrow_{\mathit{obj}}$ is distributed linearizable, and $\mathit{lin} \uparrow_{ \mathit{obj} }$ is a linearization of $h \uparrow_{\mathit{obj}}$.
\end{enumerate}

A set $H$ of multi-object histories are distributed linearizable w.r.t deterministic sequential specifications, if each of its history is.
\end{definition}

The following is the definition of compositional histories. 

\begin{definition}[Compositionality]
\label{definition:compositionality}
A history $h$ of multiple objects is called compositional, if $h \uparrow_{\mathit{obj}}$ is distributed linearizable for each object $\mathit{obj}$, if and only if, $h$ is distributed linearizable. 
\end{definition}




\subsection{Composing Several t0}
\label{subsec:composing several t0}



\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:invariant of operation-based CRDT implies distributed linearizability for t0-specification}
If there exists an invariant $P$ for a CRDT object $\mathit{obj}$ and a t0-specification $\mathit{spec}$, then each history of $\mathit{history}(\llbracket \mathit{obj} \rrbracket_{\mathit{op}})$ is distributed linearizable w.r.t $\mathit{spec}$, and each sequences that consistent with visibility is a linearization of $h$.
\end{lemma}
